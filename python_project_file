This is where all of the lore and the ideas will be stored.

RULES (in progress):
> When a player enters the maze, they choose their name, race, and role, which defines their power/health
> Races to choose from: Human, Dwarf, Elf
> Roles to choose from: Wizard, Archer, Warrior
> Stats max out at 10, if health reaches 0, you must restart
> Must defeat 5 monsters along the way through 5 stages (or luckily get through the clear path)

GAME FLOW:
1. Choose a name, then a race and role which determines your skills & health
2. Three main skills (power, speed, and wisdom) are calculated and health is established
    a. you should have the ability to check the status of your skills at any point by typing "stats" at any time
3. The player must decide to enter the maze of monsters
    a. upon entering the maze, the paths are created for each of the five stages
    b. each stage should have a random number of paths between 2-5
4. As the player proceeds through the maze, they choose their path for each stage
    a. most paths will have monsters, but sometimes it may be a clear path
5. When a player encounters a monster, they will have two options (fight, run)
    FIGHT 
    1. IF: higher power & higher/equal wisdom, they will defeat, and lose zero health
    2. IF: higher power & lesser wisdom OR: equal power & higher wisdom they will defeat, but lose health equal to 25% of the monster's power
    3. IF: equal power & equal wisdom OR: lesser power & higher wisdom: they will defeat, but lose health equal to 50% of the monster's power
    4. IF: equal power & lesser wisdom OR: lesser power & equal wisdom: they will defeat, but lose health equal to 75% of the monster's power
    5. IF: lesser power & lesser wisdom, they will be defeated
    RUN
    1. IF: higher speed & higher/equal wisdom, they will defeat, and lose zero health
    2. IF: higher speed & lesser wisdom OR: equal speed & higher wisdom they will defeat, but lose health equal to 25% of the monster's power
    3. IF: equal speed & equal wisdom OR: lesser speed & higher wisdom: they will defeat, but lose health equal to 50% of the monster's power
    4. IF: equal speed & lesser wisdom OR: lesser speed & equal wisdom: they will defeat, but lose health equal to 75% of the monster's power
    5. IF: lesser speed & lesser wisdom, they will be defeated
6. If a stage is cleared, the player has the option to increase 2 stat points however they'd like before moving to the next stage
    a. if a monster was killed, you can upgrade 2 stat points and regain 2 health
    b. if you clear a stage through an easy path, you can upgrade 1 stat points and gain 1 health
7. After all 5 stages are completed, the player will exit the maze and complete the game successfully
